    <center><h2>Background and how we started</h2></center>
        <center><p><strong>The corporate has been in business since 1950, we were one of the biggest cruise ship corporation <br>
                           At that time. Mister Minion Boss Baby, was the man who made it all and he began by inventing a wooden <br>
                           boat, it was very famous at that time, he then sell it and then came up with a very futuristic boat, not <br>
                           just any boat but a cruise, a mega mega boat. Once he invented it, he made profits up to 10 Trillion Dollar. <br>
                           
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           Later in the 70s, Mister Lord of Lord stepped up and became the new chairman of the company, began making something <br>
                           better than mega mega boat, not just a boat but a Giant Cruise Ship, he then sold it and got the profits of 90 Trillion Dollar.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           Once the era of the 70s passed, Mister King of Lord stepped up and became the chairman, he invented a modern Life-Jacket, which <br>
                           saves many many many life on this planet. He also invented a modern lifeboat and sold it getting the profits of 98 Trillion Dollar <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           And that is how the corporation was founded and continued to these days, the corporation has over 90,000 Staff Member, across the entire <br>
                           world, and it networth is over 12 million million USD.</strong></p></center>
